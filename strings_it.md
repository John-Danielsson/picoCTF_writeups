Can you find the flag in [file]() without running it?
### Hints

### Solution

**STEP 1**

Let's look at the image:

![A picture of a garden.](./img/garden.jpg "What's hidden in here?")

**STEP 2**

If you don't already have a hex editor on your computer, you can go to this link: https://hexed.it.

**STEP 3**

Upload garden.jpg to your hex editor and use control + F to find the term "pico".

We find "Here is a flag "picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3657BaB2C}"."

Thus, we have the flag:

```picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3657BaB2C}```
