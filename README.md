# picoCTF_writeups
This repository is a compilation of my write-ups for cybersecurity exercises found at https://picoctf.org. 

I'll explain each problem to the best of my abilities, and I hope that you will find these write-ups useful.

A word of caution: If you are attempting to solve the problems on the picoCTF site, do not rely solely on these write-ups to get you through. That won't help you understand the necessary skills to solve the problem at hand. 

Wherever possible, I will format each write-up in such a way that you can scroll through each step incrementally without seeing what the next step is (i.e. you'll be able to give yourself hints if you get stuck). 

Finally, note that each method shown in this repository is not necessarily the only solution to its relevant problem.
